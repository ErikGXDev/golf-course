# Golf Course: Ocean Wave Edition

**...is a short mini-golf game set in the ocean.**

"Golf Course: Ocean Wave Edition" is a rebuilt version of one of my older games called "Golf Course". Enhancements over the old version include smoother framerates, much better graphics and new levels.

**Play it now on itch.io: https://erikgxdev.itch.io/golf-course**

(Alternatively, the game is also on my website: https://golf-course.eriko.dev)
