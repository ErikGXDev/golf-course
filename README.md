# KAPLAY Golf Arcade

(name subject to change)

The KAPLAY Golf Arcade is a rebuilt version of one of my older games called "Golf Course". Your goal is to navigate across many different golf levels. Enhancements over the old version include smoother framerates, better graphics and more game mechanics like switch-activated walls.
